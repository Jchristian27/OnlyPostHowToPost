  <h1 class="headercenter">General Posting Guidelines</h1>
  <h2 class="headercenter">Please read the guidelines outlined below and keep them in mind while posting with OnlyPost. Not following the guidlines below and/or abusing OnlyPost may result in getting banned from certain subreddits and/or the deletion of your account. We will not be liable for such outcomes if the simple guidelines listed below are not followed.</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>OnlyPost can only post images and videoGIFs. <b>IT CANNOT POST VIDEOS THAT ARE NOT GIFs.</b> You can turn a video from a cell phone or camera into a videoGIF for free by using <a href="https://express.adobe.com/tools/convert-to-gif" target="_blank">this Adobe website.</a> This website makes the best videoGIFs out of all the sites we have researched and it is free to use as well. All you need to do is make a free account with Adobe to use it. Make sure you select large under the 'file size' menu when creating your videoGIFs. If you already have a website that you prefer to use to create videoGIFs and you are happy with it then feel free to keep using it. <b>RedGIFs will not work with OnlyPost because it works by embedding GIFs directly on Reddit. Using the Adobe site that was mentioned earlier is just as easy as using RedGIFs though, so no need to worry :)</b></li>
      <br>
      <!--<li>When saving photos and videoGIFs onto your computer don’t include any white spaces in the image/videoGIF file names (e.g. make sure you save your photo as &nbsp;<code>my_gorgeous_self.jpg</code>&nbsp; rather than &nbsp;<code>my gorgeous self.jpg</code>). If your file names have white spaces in them your script will not be able to post them.</li>-->
      <li>If you chose any subs on your intake form that require you to verify yourself, please do so manually before posting with OnlyPost.</li>
      <br>
      <li>Don’t mention your OnlyFans or Fansly anywhere in your posts. These get flagged as spam in most subs and get less engagement in general. If someone is interested in you enough to join your OnlyFans, then they will take the time to look through your Reddit profile and find the link to your OnlyFans in your bio.</li>
      <br>
      <li>Don’t post captions that ask for karma or imply a request for karma. Sub mods hate this and doing so may get you banned from that sub.</li>
      <br>
      <li>Don't use OnlyPost more than once per day. Using your OnlyPost multiple times per day for prolonged periods of time will likely result in your account getting flagged as spam and deleted. You can still post a few other photos and videoGIFs manually to other subs on the same days you post with OnlyPost -- just don't abuse it and use it to post an inappropriate amount of times. Posting a moderate amount of content on a daily basis will get you more engagement in the long run anyway.  </li>
    </ol>
<br>
  <h1 class="headercenter">How to Post Pictures & Videos Using OnlyPost</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>Open a new terminal window.</li>
      <li>Type <code>post</code> and hit enter.</li>
      <li>Type out the caption for your photo or videoGIF and hit enter.</li>
      <li>Open Finder (the white and blue smiley face in your dock) and drag and drop whatever photo or videoGIF you want to post onto the terminal.</li>
      <li>Dragging and dropping an image or videoGIF from your finder will deselect the terminal window. Click back onto the terminal window so you can continue.</li>
      <li>Hit enter.</li>
      <li>A list of genres will be presented to you. Determine what genre the content you're about to post falls under, type it into the terminal, and hit enter.</li>
      <li>Leave the terminal open until the script is done executing. When the script is done executing a message that says <code> All done! You can now close the terminal window :) </code> will be printed out onto the terminal.</li>
      <li>That's it! Close the terminal window and repeat the next time you want to post a photo or videoGIF.</li>
    </ol> 
    <br>
    <h1 class="headercenter">Video Walkthrough</h1>
    <h2 class="headercenter">Click the gear icon when the video starts playing to change the video quality to 720p if it appears blurry. Please note that in the video below OnlyPost only takes 30 seconds to execute. This is shorter than your custom version of OnlyPost will take for the sake of brevity so that you don't have to watch a long video. Your version of OnlyPost will take 2-5 minutes depending on how many subreddits it is posting to.</h2>
