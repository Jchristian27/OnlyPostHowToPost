  <h1 class="headercenter">General Posting Guidelines</h1>
  <h2 class="headercenter">Please read the guidelines outlined below and keep them in mind while posting with OnlyPost. Not following the guidelines below and/or abusing OnlyPost may result in getting banned from certain subreddits and/or the deletion of your account. We will not be liable for such outcomes if the simple guidelines listed below are not followed.</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>OnlyPost has been tested and designed to post images from Imgur and videoGIFs from RedGIFs only by using an Imgur image or RedGIFs videoGIF URL. While OnlyPost may work with other sites, Imgur and RedGIFs are the only sites that we guarantee will work with OnlyPost. Imgur and RedGIFs are also two of the websites that Reddit subs prefer OnlyFans creators use, so it's in your best interest to use them when posting with OnlyScript since both websites are currently the gold standard for media hosting and are both free to use.</li>
      <br>
      <li>If you chose any subs on your intake form that require you to verify yourself, please do so manually before posting with OnlyPost. Even if you didn't select any subs that you require you to verify yourself, you must manually verify yourself on r/Amateur prior to using OnlyPost as it is one of the generic subs we have selected to help you reach more people and they require verification prior to posting original content. </li>
      <br>
      <li>Stick with softcore and solo content. Many subs are sticklers about posting content with penetration, penises, anal, etc. If you want to post more hardcore content, please post that content manually to subs that don't mind it. Using OnlyPost to post such content may result in getting banned from some of the subs we have selected for their ability to grow your audience.</li>
      <br>
      <li>Refrain from using watermarks on your images/videoGIFs. Most subs don't really like these and mods may decide to ban you for it. If you insist on having a watermark, keep it small and make sure it is only your Reddit username and not your OnlyFans username/link. Mods will ban you for that.</li>
      <br>
      <li>Don’t mention your OnlyFans or Fansly anywhere in your posts. These get flagged as spam in most subs and get less engagement in general. If someone is interested in you enough to join your OnlyFans, then they will take the time to look through your Reddit profile and find the link to your OnlyFans in your bio.</li>
      <br>
      <li>Don’t post captions that ask for karma or imply a request for karma. Sub mods hate this and doing so may get you banned from that sub.</li>
      <br>
      <li>Don't use OnlyPost more than once per day. Using your OnlyPost multiple times per day for prolonged periods of time will likely result in your account getting flagged as spam and deleted. You can still post a few other photos and videoGIFs manually to other subs on the same days you post with OnlyPost -- just don't abuse it and use it to post an inappropriate amount of times. Posting a moderate amount of content on a daily basis will get you more engagement in the long run anyway.  </li>
    </ol>
<br>
  <h1 class="headercenter">How to Post Pictures & Videos Using OnlyPost</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>Open a new terminal window.</li>
      <li>Type <code>post</code> and hit enter.</li>
      <li>Type out the caption for your photo or videoGIF and hit enter.</li>
      <li>Copy the URL of the imgur photo or RedGifs video that you want to post, paste it into the terminal, and hit enter.</li>
      <li>A list of genres will be presented to you. Determine what genre the content you're about to post falls under, type it into the terminal, and hit enter.</li>
      <li>Leave the terminal open until the script is done executing. When the script is done executing a message that says <code> All done! You can now close the terminal window :) </code> will be printed out onto the terminal.</li>
      <li>That's it! Close the terminal window and repeat the next time you want to post a photo or videoGIF.</li>
    </ol> 
    <br>
    <h1 class="headercenter">Video Walkthrough</h1>
    <h3 class="headercenter">Click the gear icon when the video starts playing to change the video quality to 720p if it appears blurry. Please note that in the video below OnlyPost only takes ~30 seconds to execute. This is shorter than your custom version of OnlyPost will take for the sake of brevity so that you don't have to watch a long video. Your version of OnlyPost will take 2-5 minutes depending on how many subreddits it is posting to.</h2>
